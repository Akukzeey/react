///RANDOM NOTES//
-React is a javascript library for building user interfaces

-What to write in index.js
  import React from "react";
  import App from "./App";
  import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client";

  const container=document.querySelector('#root')
  const root=createRoot(container)
  root.render(<App/>)

-What to write in App.js(function component)
 import React from "react"
 function App() {
     return(
         <div>
             <h1 className='title'>Hello there</h1>
         </div>
     )

 }


 export default App


/////useState/////
-We use a state system anytime we want react to update the content on the screen.



-In React it's a normal convention to use double quotes in JSX properties like: class="label"  for="name"  and single quotes anywhere else like:  style={{background:"blue",color:'white',border:'none'}}
-Although you can still use it either way



////CALLING A VARIABLE AND A COMPONENT IN JSX////
-When you want to call a variable in a jsx file we use curly bracels{clickOnMe})
-But when you want to call a component in jsx we use <App/>




////MAIN NOTES////

QUESTION1=Create a JSX code from this HTML code:
            <div>
            <label class="label" for="name">
            Enter name:
            <label/>
            <input id="name" type="text" />
             <button style="background-color: blue; color:white">Submit</button>
            <div/>

QUESTION2

                 }

                 <button style={{background: "blue", color: 'white', border: 'none'}}>  {clickOnMe()}  </button>



 ////PROPS or PROPERTIES////
-This is system for passing data from a parent component to a child component.
-The goal of PROPS is to customize/configure a child component or how the user interacts with it.



///WHAT'S A COMPONENT//
-This is a function or a class that produces HTML to show the user using JSX and handles feedback from the user using event handlers.


///SIMILARITIES BTW FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT AND A CLASS COMPONENT///
-They both produce JSX to show content to the user
-Class component Can use the lifecycle Method system to run code at specific points in time while functional components uses HOOKS to run code at a specific points in time
-Class component use the 'STATE' system to update content on the screen while functional components uses HOOKS to access state system and update content on the screen
